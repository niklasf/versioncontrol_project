Version Control / Project Node Integration -
Integrates nodes of any content type with version control systems
supported by the Version Control API.


SHORT DESCRIPTION
-----------------
This module is a work in progress, and not yet ready to use.
It's one of those modules being created within the Google Summer of Code 2007.
When it's done, the description might look approximately like this:

This module provides integration of Drupal nodes ("project nodes") with
repositories that have been set up with Version Control API, most prominently
featuring commit access control based on project maintainership.

Version Control / Project Node Integration depends on the
Version Control API module.

CVS integration module on drupal.org, where the adapted sections
were committed by:

This module was originally created as part of Google Summer of Code 2007,
so Google also deserves some credits for making this possible.
